## Baba’s Best Bsalmon:
Objective: regain elby’s confidence with cooking fish. Also don’t listen to nathan’s advice
Let salmon defrost at room temperature in a propped-up bowl (place towel underneath or something). Allows water to not pool in the salmon, gravity something something
Before cooking, if not completely dried, pat salmon down with paper towel
Put pan on high heat with some oil
Once hot, place salmon in and let cook for 2-3 minutes until looks like this


Give it a flip so it looks like this

Now’s time to add some flavor. Lower heat to med-low so that oil doesn’t splatter in your face and ruin your new wireless headphones. Once not hissing, add some ginger.

Turn heat back to high and cover with pan. Cook for additional 2-3 minutes. 
Once you’ve got some nice brownage on both sides, quickly throw in some green onion or whatever. Green onion goes in near the end of cooking so it doesn’t become soggy and bad

After indeterminate amount of time, add the saucey sauce. Baba opts for the following
Shao xing cooking wine
Soy sauce
Salt (as needed)
Small pinch sugar (optional)
Small pinch pepper (optional)

Eat. for tonight’s meal, other dishes include bok choy, pork with spicy peppers and shiitake mushrooms, eggplant, random leftovers.
